 
 During Discovery and Inventory phases:
  - ‚úÖ 100% Safe - Nothing in AWS will be deleted, modified, or created
  - ‚úÖ Read-Only - Only collecting metadata about your resources
  - ‚úÖ No Downtime - Your applications continue running normally
  - ‚úÖ Reversible - You can stop the process anytime with no AWS impact

  The discovery phase is essentially like running a detailed "inventory scan" of your AWS environment to understand what resources exist and how they're configured. It's completely safe to proceed.

  You can confidently run the discovery knowing that your AWS environment remains completely unchanged until you explicitly choose to start replication later in the process.

‚óè OCI Charging for Discovery and Inventory - Complete Breakdown

  Discovery Phase Charges: MINIMAL

  What's FREE during Discovery:

  ‚úÖ Oracle Cloud Migrations Service Usage: FREE
  ‚úÖ Asset Source Creation: FREE
  ‚úÖ Discovery Execution: FREE
  ‚úÖ Inventory Storage: FREE (metadata storage is negligible)
  ‚úÖ Migration Project Creation: FREE
  ‚úÖ Migration Planning: FREE

  What Has MINIMAL Charges during Discovery:

  Potential Small Charges:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è API Calls: ~$0.01-$0.05 for entire discovery
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Object Storage: ~$0.01-$0.02/month for inventory metadata
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Logging: ~$0.00-$0.01 if audit logging enabled

  Total Discovery Cost: ~$0.02-$0.10 maximum

  Actual Chargeable Resources During Discovery

  1. Object Storage (Negligible)

  What: Inventory metadata storage
  Size: ~1-10MB for typical discovery
  Cost: $0.0255 per GB/month = ~$0.0003/month
  Annual Cost: ~$0.004

  2. API Gateway Calls (If Any)

  What: OCI service-to-service API calls
  Volume: ~100-500 calls for discovery
  Cost: $0.34 per million calls = ~$0.0002

  3. Audit Logging (Optional)

  What: Discovery activity logs (if enabled)
  Size: ~1-5MB for discovery logs
  Cost: $0.50 per GB = ~$0.003

  What Gets EXPENSIVE Later (Not During Discovery)

  Replication Phase Charges:

  Major Costs Come Later:
  üí∞ Hydration Agent Compute: $0.05-$0.50/hour per agent
  üí∞ Object Storage for Replication: $0.0255/GB for transferred data
  üí∞ Block Volume Storage: $0.0255/GB/month for replicated volumes
  üí∞ Network Egress: $0.0085/GB for data transfer from AWS

  Discovery ‚â† Replication (Discovery is cheap, Replication has real costs)

  Real-World Discovery Cost Example

  For Your 2 Test Instances:

  Discovery Inventory:
  - 2 EC2 instances metadata: ~2KB each
  - Volume information: ~1KB per volume
  - Network metadata: ~1KB
  - Total metadata: ~10KB

  Storage Cost: $0.0255/GB √ó 0.00001GB = $0.0000003/month
  API Calls: ~50 calls √ó $0.34/million = $0.000017
  Total Discovery Cost: ~$0.00002 (2 cents per 1000 months!)

  Cost Optimization Tips

  Keep Discovery Costs Near Zero:

  ‚úÖ Run discovery once, not repeatedly
  ‚úÖ Delete unused asset sources after migration
  ‚úÖ Don't enable optional cost/metrics collection unless needed
  ‚úÖ Use compartment-based cost tracking

  Prepare for Later Replication Costs:

  Real costs come during replication:
  üìä Plan replication during off-peak hours
  üìä Monitor hydration agent usage
  üìä Clean up replicated volumes after migration
  üìä Use appropriate block volume performance tiers

  Summary: Discovery Cost Reality

  Discovery Phase:
  - Cost: ~$0.00-$0.10 total (essentially free)
  - Duration: One-time activity
  - Resources: Just metadata storage and API calls

  What to Budget For Later:
  - Replication: $10-$100+ depending on data volume
  - Compute: $5-$50+ for hydration agents
  - Storage: $10-$200+ for replicated block volumes

  Bottom Line: The discovery and inventory phases are essentially FREE - the real costs come later during replication when you're actually moving data and creating compute resources.
