Oracle Cloud Bridge (OCB)

Oracle Cloud Bridge is Oracleâ€™s framework/service for discovery, assessment, and migration of workloads into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It integrates multiple services and tools (both native and partner) to provide an end-to-end migration journey.

Key components:

Discovery & Assessment

Uses OCI Cloud Migrations Service (CMS), Application Discovery, or partner integrations (like Cloudamize, Device42, etc.) to scan your AWS, Azure, VMware, or on-prem environment.

Collects inventory metadata (instances, VMs, storage, networks, databases).

Generates reports: utilization, sizing, dependencies.

Migration & Replication

Replication Manager / CMS handles block-level replication from AWS EBS, VMware, or on-prem storage to OCI Object Storage.

Data is staged â†’ transformed â†’ provisioned into OCI Block Volumes, Compute, VCNs, etc.

Automation using Terraform, SDKs, or Oracle Migration toolkits.

Integration with Governance & Ops

OCI Resource Manager (Terraform) for infra provisioning.

OCI Operations services (Cloud Guard, Logging, Monitoring) for security and observability.

Ensures compliance with tenancy security rules.

ðŸ”¹ Migration Project Lifecycle

Yes â€” migration projects always split into phases (your diagram already shows something similar):

1. Discovery Phase

Inventory collection

AWS APIs (EC2, EBS, RDS, VPC) or VMware vCenter, or on-prem scanning.

Dependency mapping

Which app servers talk to which DBs.

Assessment & sizing

Right-size compute, DB shape, storage type (Block Volumes, File Storage, Object).

Readiness report

Highlight OS versions, licensing, unsupported features.

ðŸ‘‰ Deliverable: Migration Assessment Report + Target Architecture.

2. Migration Phase

Planning

Which workloads first (usually non-prod), cutover strategy (big bang vs wave-based).

Replication & Staging

Data copied to OCI Object Storage â†’ Block Volumes.

Provisioning

Create VCNs, Subnets, IAM policies, Compute Shapes in OCI.

Cutover

Switch traffic (DNS, LB), validate workloads, decommission legacy infra.

ðŸ‘‰ Deliverable: Running application in OCI with verification & rollback plan.

Your Flowchart vs. Phases

Your diagram shows:

Discovery Phase â†’ (AWS APIs â†’ Inventory DB â†’ Resource Selection UI â†’ Migration Plan Generator).

Migration Phase â†’ (Snapshots â†’ Transfer â†’ OCI provisioning â†’ Cutover).

Thatâ€™s exactly how OCI Cloud Bridge orchestrates it.

Discovery Phase Inventory Details 
  Oracle Cloud Bridge Asset Storage

  When using Oracle Cloud Bridge (not the console), discovered assets are stored in:

  Oracle's Internal Inventory Database

  - Location: Oracle's managed database service (not in your tenancy)
  - Access: Via Oracle Cloud Bridge APIs and Cloud Migration APIs
  - Format: Structured inventory data accessible through REST endpoints

  Your OCI Tenancy Storage

  - Object Storage Bucket: Stores discovery snapshots and metadata
  - Location: ocm-replication-bucket (created by prerequisites)
  - Purpose: Staging area for migration data and backup inventory

  What Our Prerequisites Actually Create

  Looking at our current main.tf, we do NOT create any databases. The prerequisites only create:

  # Storage (not database)
  resource "oci_objectstorage_bucket" "replication_bucket"

  # Security
  resource "oci_kms_vault" "ocm_secrets"
  resource "oci_kms_key" "ocm_key"

  # IAM (Identity and Access Management)
  resource "oci_identity_dynamic_group" "migration_dynamic_group"
  resource "oci_identity_policy" "migration_compartment_policy"

  Asset Discovery Flow

  1. Discovery: Oracle Cloud Bridge discovers AWS assets â†’ Stored in Oracle's managed inventory
  2. API Access: Our app calls Oracle APIs â†’ Gets discovered assets from Oracle's inventory
  3. Local Cache: Our app can cache/display this data â†’ But it's sourced from Oracle's APIs
  4. Migration: Oracle uses its inventory â†’ Creates resources in your OCI tenancy

  No Database in Prerequisites

  The prerequisites are purely for:
  - Identity/Access: Permissions for Oracle services to work
  - Security: KMS for credential encryption
  - Storage: Object storage for migration data staging

  The actual asset inventory lives in Oracle's managed service, accessible via their APIs.
