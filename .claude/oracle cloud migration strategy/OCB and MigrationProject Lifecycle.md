Oracle Cloud Bridge (OCB)

Oracle Cloud Bridge is Oracleâ€™s framework/service for discovery, assessment, and migration of workloads into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It integrates multiple services and tools (both native and partner) to provide an end-to-end migration journey.

Key components:

Discovery & Assessment

Uses OCI Cloud Migrations Service (CMS), Application Discovery, or partner integrations (like Cloudamize, Device42, etc.) to scan your AWS, Azure, VMware, or on-prem environment.

Collects inventory metadata (instances, VMs, storage, networks, databases).

Generates reports: utilization, sizing, dependencies.

Migration & Replication

Replication Manager / CMS handles block-level replication from AWS EBS, VMware, or on-prem storage to OCI Object Storage.

Data is staged â†’ transformed â†’ provisioned into OCI Block Volumes, Compute, VCNs, etc.

Automation using Terraform, SDKs, or Oracle Migration toolkits.

Integration with Governance & Ops

OCI Resource Manager (Terraform) for infra provisioning.

OCI Operations services (Cloud Guard, Logging, Monitoring) for security and observability.

Ensures compliance with tenancy security rules.

ðŸ”¹ Migration Project Lifecycle

Yes â€” migration projects always split into phases (your diagram already shows something similar):

1. Discovery Phase

Inventory collection

AWS APIs (EC2, EBS, RDS, VPC) or VMware vCenter, or on-prem scanning.

Dependency mapping

Which app servers talk to which DBs.

Assessment & sizing

Right-size compute, DB shape, storage type (Block Volumes, File Storage, Object).

Readiness report

Highlight OS versions, licensing, unsupported features.

ðŸ‘‰ Deliverable: Migration Assessment Report + Target Architecture.

2. Migration Phase

Planning

Which workloads first (usually non-prod), cutover strategy (big bang vs wave-based).

Replication & Staging

Data copied to OCI Object Storage â†’ Block Volumes.

Provisioning

Create VCNs, Subnets, IAM policies, Compute Shapes in OCI.

Cutover

Switch traffic (DNS, LB), validate workloads, decommission legacy infra.

ðŸ‘‰ Deliverable: Running application in OCI with verification & rollback plan.

Your Flowchart vs. Phases

Your diagram shows:

Discovery Phase â†’ (AWS APIs â†’ Inventory DB â†’ Resource Selection UI â†’ Migration Plan Generator).

Migration Phase â†’ (Snapshots â†’ Transfer â†’ OCI provisioning â†’ Cutover).

Thatâ€™s exactly how OCI Cloud Bridge orchestrates it.
