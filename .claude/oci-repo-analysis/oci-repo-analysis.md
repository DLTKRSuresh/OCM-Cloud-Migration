● Based on my analysis of the Oracle OCM repository, here's what Oracle provides for AWS discovery:

  Oracle's AWS Discovery Implementation

  What Oracle Provides for AWS Discovery

  1. AWS IAM Policies (Pre-defined by Oracle)

  Oracle provides two specific AWS IAM policy files in their OCM repository:

  Discovery Policy (aws-discovery-policy.json):

  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                  "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes",
                  "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                  "ce:GetCostAndUsageWithResources",
                  "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                  "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }

  Replication Policy (aws-replication-policy.json):

  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "ebs:ListChangedBlocks",
                  "ebs:ListSnapshotBlocks",
                  "ebs:GetSnapshotBlock",
                  "ec2:CreateSnapshots",
                  "ec2:CreateTags",
                  "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                  "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                  "ec2:DescribeSnapshots"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }

  2. What Oracle Does NOT Provide

  Missing Components:
  - No Python/Java/other language discovery scripts for AWS
  - No AWS SDK implementation (no boto3 or AWS API calling code)
  - No automated discovery tools that actually connect to AWS
  - No database schema for storing discovered AWS resources
  - No inventory management system for AWS resources

  3. Oracle's Approach vs Custom Discovery

  Oracle's Actual Implementation:
  - Oracle relies on Oracle Cloud Migrations (OCM) Service in OCI Console
  - Uses Discovery Agents that must be deployed in customer environments
  - Discovery happens through OCI's managed service, not direct AWS API calls
  - Customer must set up cross-account trust relationships manually

  What's Missing for Custom Implementation:
  - Direct AWS API discovery code
  - Resource inventory database design
  - Resource selection and planning interface
  - Migration execution logic

  Key Findings - Oracle's Limitations

  Oracle Focuses on:

  1. OCI Prerequisites Setup - Terraform for OCI resources
  2. Post-Migration Scripts - Python scripts for managing OCI resources after migration
  3. VMware-focused tooling - Most scripts are for VMware environments
  4. Policy Templates - AWS IAM policies but no code to use them

  Oracle Does NOT Provide:

  1. Direct AWS Discovery Code - No actual discovery implementation
  2. API Integration Logic - No boto3 or AWS SDK usage examples
  3. Custom Migration Tools - Relies entirely on OCI Console-based workflow
  4. Automated Resource Discovery - Requires manual setup through OCI Console

  Recommendation for Custom Tool Development

  Since Oracle only provides IAM policy templates but no actual discovery code, you'll need to build the discovery engine from scratch using:

  What to Build:

  1. AWS API Discovery Engine
    - Use boto3 Python SDK with Oracle's provided IAM policies
    - Implement multi-region, multi-service discovery
    - Create resource inventory database
  2. Resource Management System
    - Store discovered resources in database
    - Provide selection interface for migration planning
    - Track migration status and progress
  3. Migration Execution Engine
    - Implement snapshot creation and transfer
    - Handle AMI export and OCI import processes
    - Orchestrate wave-based migration execution

  Starting Point:

  - Use Oracle's AWS IAM policies as the foundation for permissions
  - Build discovery scripts using AWS public APIs (EC2, EBS, VPC, RDS)
  - Extend beyond Oracle's basic policies to include comprehensive resource discovery
  - Create your own inventory and migration management system

  Conclusion: Oracle provides the IAM permission templates but expects customers to use their managed OCM service through the OCI Console. For a truly
  custom solution, you need to build the entire discovery and migration engine yourself using AWS public APIs.
