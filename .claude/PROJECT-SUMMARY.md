## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### **Step 1: AWS IAM Configuration (This Week)**
```bash
Priority: HIGH - Required before discovery can begin

Actions Required:
1. Login to AWS Console with IAM admin privileges
2. Create IAM policies using provided JSON files:
   - aws-discovery-policy.json
   - aws-replication-policy.json
3. Create IAM user 'oci-migration-user' with policies attached
4. Generate and securely store AWS access keys
5. Test connectivity from OCI Console

Estimated Time: 2-3 hours
Responsible: AWS Administrator
```

### **Step 2: Discovery Execution (Next Week)**
```bash
Priority: HIGH - Foundation for entire migration

Actions Required:
1. Configure AWS Asset Source in OCI Console
2. Create and execute full environment discovery
3. Validate resource inventory (100% accuracy target)
4. Review dependency mapping and complexity assessment
5. Finalize target OCI architecture based on discovery

Estimated Time: 3-5 days
Responsible: Migration Team + OCI Administrator
```

### **Step 3: Pilot Migration Planning (Week After Next)**
```bash
Priority: MEDIUM - Builds on discovery results

Actions Required:
1. Select non-production environment for pilot
2. Create detailed migration project and plan
3. Execute pilot migration with full monitoring
4. Validate all functionality and performance
5. Document lessons learned and optimize procedures

Estimated Time: 1 week
Responsible: Full Migration Team
```
